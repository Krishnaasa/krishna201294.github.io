          <h3 class="section-heading">The IEEE Fourth International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest 2022) </h3>
          <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used in computer applications to perform tasks such as monitoring,
             forecasting, recommending, prediction, and statistical reporting. They are deployed in a variety of systems including
              driverless vehicles, robot-controlled warehouses, financial forecasting applications, and security enforcement and are 
              increasingly integrated with cloud/fog/edge computing, big data analytics, robotics, Internet-of-Things, mobile computing,
               smart cities, smart homes, intelligent healthcare, etc. In spite of this dramatic progress, the quality 
               assurance of existing AI application development processes is still far from satisfactory and the demand for being 
               able to show demonstrable levels of confidence in such systems is growing. Software testing is a fundamental, 
               effective and recognized quality assurance method which has shown its cost-effectiveness to ensure the reliability 
               of many complex software systems. However, the adaptation of software testing to the peculiarities of AI applications 
               remains largely unexplored and needs extensive research to be performed. On the other hand, the availability of 
               AI technologies provides an exciting opportunity to improve existing software testing processes, and recent years have 
               shown that machine learning, data mining, knowledge representation, constraint optimization, planning, scheduling, 
               multi-agent systems, etc. have real potential to positively impact on software testing. Recent years have seen a rapid 
               growth of interests in testing AI applications as well as application of AI techniques to software testing. 
               This conference provides an international forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange novel research results, 
               to articulate the problems and challenges from practices, to deepen our understanding of the subject area with new theories, 
               methodologies, techniques, processes models, etc., and to improve the practices with new tools and resources.

          <h3 class="section-heading">The 13th IEEE International Conference on JointCloud Computing </h3>
          <p>
            Cloud Computing technologies have become the backbone of modern IT infrastructures. Businesses usually adopt a multi-hybrid 
            cloud strategy to achieve optimized portfolios of cloud services provided by different vendors and avoid single vendor lock-in. 
            Meanwhile, this strategy brings technical challenges and complexities to build, manage and operate multi-hybrid clouds. 
            JointCloud is used to refer to but not limited to Hybrid-Cloud, Inter-Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Federation, 
            Cross-Cloud and Cloud Service Broker (CSB) etc. IEEE JCC 2022 aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners 
            to exchange innovative ideas, latest research results, and practical experiences and lessons learned around JointCloud. 
            This years’ conference is scheduled to take place in the San Francisco Bay Area, from 15-18 August 2022. 
            Please see our Call for Papers via the menu above.

          <h3 class="section-heading">IEEE International Congress On Intelligent And Service-Oriented Systems Engineering</h3>
          <p>Service-Oriented Computing exploits services as the fundamental elements of computer-based systems. It has been applied 
            to various areas and promotes fundamental changes to the way software systems are being analyzed, architected, 
            designed, implemented, tested, evaluated, delivered, consumed, maintained and evolved. Consequently, a new paradigm of 
            software and system engineering discipline, i.e., Service-Oriented Engineering, has emerged and advanced rapidly in the
             past decade. Among many remarkable milestones in the development of this new paradigm are the wide adoption of the 
             Microservices architectural style supported by Docker and other container-based virtualization techniques in the design
            of cloud native applications in the industry, and the DevOps movement in the organization of development processes 
            supported by automated tools for continuous testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Recent advances
            in Service-Oriented Computing (SOC), in particular Internet-of-Things, Industry 4.0, Edge and Fog computing, mobile and
            cloud computing combined with Big Data analytics, robotics, blockchain and decentralized ledger applications, and 
            application of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques, etc., have provided exciting opportunities to 
            make significant progress in understanding and solving complex real-world challenges. Such challenges typically require 
            a system-level approach that models a complex system at different levels of abstraction, helps to develop sound 
            architectures for addressing separate system requirements and concerns, and integrates diverse sources of knowledge in 
            the system’s components and their interactions. Therefore, the revolution of the software and system engineering paradigm 
            brought by service-orientation is still unfolding, with each new technology development bringing new challenges and
            opportunities.</p>
